This is a scenario-based text game where you are put in the shoes of hospital administrator. You are faced with challenges where privacy concepts such as GDPR and information governance can be broken. Your goal is to make the right choices so that the hospital does not break any privacy laws. 

To navigate through the game, you can click on the text highlighted in blue. If you make a mistake and want to go back to a previous page you can click the undo button located on the top left. You also have a mistake counter for if you make a mistake in the game.

Good luck!

You get to work, it's Monday, when it is typically very busy.

You have lots of work to do today, as an administrator you need to answer E-mails from patients, doctors and external surgeries. These E-mails can often be queries for blood results, scan results and clinic letters. 

You also are required to type up letters for the patients who are seen in the clinic by the conultant who dictates these. 

Letters that you recieve from patients need actioning and they need to be scanned into the patients medical record. Some of these actions include needing to book in and schedule patients into your clinic to be seen face to face or via telephone.

Now that you are clear on your job description let's [[continue on with the work day->Challenge 1]].

You gave the caller all the information he has requested. The caller expresses that he is very happy with the information and medical record that you have sent. 

This answer is incorrect because it violates the patient's privacy and confidentiality. Without verifying the caller's identity, it's impossible to know if they are authorized to receive the information or if they have a legitimate reason for requesting it.

<h2>$name | Mistakes: $mistakes</h2>
<h3 style="color: #EE4B2B;">Incorrect Answer ‚ùå</h3>
This answer is incorrect because once an email is sent, you lose control over its content and distribution, making it difficult to retrieve. Unauthorized access to someone's inbox can violate privacy laws and regulations. There may be copies or backups of the email beyond your control.

The correct approach is to report the mistake to the hospital's data protection officer and follow the breach notification procedure to handle the situation responsibly and protect the sensitive patient information.

<h2>$name | Mistakes: $mistakes</h2>
<h3 style="color: #EE4B2B;">Incorrect Answer ‚ùå</h3>
This answer is incorrect because the hospital has policies and procedures in place for responding to such requests. It also violates the patient's privacy and confidentiality. Without verifying the caller's identity, it's impossible to know if they are authorized to receive the information or if they have a legitimate reason for requesting. For example if the user who requested the SAR was not the patient and was someone else who could cause potential harm to the patient.

Asking the patient to fill out a form and wait for the hospital to process their request may be a more appropriate response.

The hospital has policies and procedures in place for responding to such requests, such as providing the patient with a copy of their medical records within a certain timeframe and in a specific format.

This answer is incorrect because it violates the patient's rights under applicable laws and regulations. Healthcare providers are required to provide patients with access to their medical records in a timely manner and can only refuse under certain circumstances such as:.

<li style="margin-left: 2ch">The patient isn't who they say they are.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 2ch">The requester has not been authorised to be given the information by the patient themselves.</li>

<h2>$name | Mistakes: $mistakes</h2>
