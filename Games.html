			<h2>Welcome to the game section</h2>
			<p align="center">I have created two identical games. One was created using an application called twine which allows you to create text based adventures easily with the help of HTML, JavaScript and CSS</p>

			<h2>Twine Game</h2>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./images/twinegame.png" width="500"></img></p>
			<p align="center">This is a text based scenario game, made using twine, that puts you in the position of a hospital administrator. You are faced with challenges where privacy concepts such as GDPR and information governance can be broken. Your goal is to make the right choices so that the hospital does not break any privacy laws. Think you have what it takes to complete the game? </p>
