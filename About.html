            <h2>Welcome to Teaching Privacy</h2>
            <p align="center">This is my creative piece for my project of 'Teaching privacy concepts to the public'. This website aims to teach users about many privacy concepts in the workplace. I have created two games: the twine game is the game that is the game I worked on the most and has the most features. The JavaScript game I developed was developed as I was unsure if I would be penalised for using certain frameworks such as Tweego & Twine. </p>
            <p align="center">About Twine:</p>
            <p align="center">Twine is a piece of software that allows you to create simple text adventures. However, if you use Visual Studio paired with the Tweego extension, you can accomplish many things compared to using the Twine software standalone. This also meant I had to learn a new coding language which is similar to JavaScript. This coding language allows for extra features sucha as media, UI elements, save files passage linking.</p>
            <p align="center">I hope you enjoyed my website</p>
