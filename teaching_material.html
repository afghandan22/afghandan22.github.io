        <H2>GDPR Laws</H2>
        <p>The (UK) GDPR, like most data protection legislations around the world, is built on key principles which organisations, including hospitals are required to comply with.</p>
        <p>Select the options below to learn about each principle:</p>
        <div class="accordion">
          <div class="accordion-item">
            <div class="accordion-header">Principle 1: Fair and lawful processing</div>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <h3>What does it say?</h3>
              <p> Data shall be processed lawfully and in a transparent manner.</p>
              <h3>What does it mean?</h3>
              <p>You must process data in line with the law and only if required for a legitimate purpose</p>
              <p>You are required to tell patients what Personal Data the hospital may hold about them and how you are using it. This will often be through a privacy notice.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item">
            <div class="accordion-header">Principle 2: Specified purposes</div>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <h3>What does it say?</h3>
              <p>Personal data must be obtained only for specified legitimate purposes, and
                must not be processed in a way which is incompatible with those purposes.</p>
              <h3>What does it mean?</h3>
              <p>Once the organisation has told a patient how and why they need to process their personal data, they cannot change the purposes for which they use that data, or use it for new purposes, without telling
                them.</p>
              <p>There needs to be a reason for processing the personal data and the organisation needs to
                know and reference what lawful basis applies for holding this information.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item">
            <div class="accordion-header">Principle 3: Data minimisation</div>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <h3>What does it say?</h3>
              <p>The personal data you collect must be relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
                processed.</p>
              <h3>What does it mean?</h3>
              <p>The personal data you collect must be needed, cannot be irrelevant and cannot be taken for other purposes.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item">
            <div class="accordion-header">Principle 4: Accuracy</div>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <h3>What does it say?</h3>
              <p>The personal data you collect should be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.</p>
              <h3>What does it mean?</h3>
              <p>The data you keep and process must be accurate. This is why it's important when recording information
                about patients, for example their name and address, that it is checkd recorded correctly. Incorrect
                information could lead to personal data to the wrong address which could be breach of GDPR.

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <h3>What does it say?</h3>
              <p>Personal data must be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than
                is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed.</p>

            <div class="accordion-header">Principle 6: Integrity and Security</div>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <h3>What does it say?</h3>
              <p>Individuals are able to exercise a number of rights in relation to the Personal Data which
                organisations
                hold about them.</p>
                <p>Personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection
                  against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage using
                  technical or organisational measures.</p>
              <h3>What does it mean?</h3>
              <p>In the UK and many European countries, individuals have the right to request:</p>
              <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Access to personal data which an organisation holds about them e.g. Subject Access Requests (SARs).</li>
              <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Rectification of incorrect personal data</li>
              <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Deletion of personal data in certain circumstances</li>
              <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Be able to object and restrict to their personal data being processed </li>
              <p>The hospital must secure its systems to prevent data from being lost, stolen or damaged.
                The hospital must have policies to support the way they secure personal data and make sure third party processors
                also treat data in this manner.</p>

              <h3>What does it say?</h3>
              <p>Organisations must be able to demonstrate compliance with all of the main Data Protection Principles.
              </p>
              <h3>What does it mean?</h3>
              <p>The hospital must be able to document the ways in which they meet all these requirements.</p>

        <h2>Information Governance</h2>
        <p>All staff of a hospital/organisation should be aware that:</p>
        <p>Medical records should only be accessed if staff have a legitimate reason to do so. Simply working in the hospital does not give you the right to look into anyone else's record, including your own. Examples of legitimate access include:</p>
        <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Directly caring for a patient</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Reviewing a record to provide a medical opinion (including for training purposes)</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 2%;">Checking if a patient's medical needs and condition are appropriate for a particular hospital ward</li>
        <p>If the staff do access a record for a reason that is not justified, it would be treated as a serious breach the hospital's information governance standards and the data protection act, and would be considered a criminal offence.

        <h2>Freedom of Information Act</h2>
        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>The Freedom of Information Act 2000 is a law that provides the public access to information held by public authorities including hospitals.</p>
        <h3>What this means?</h3>
        <p>In a hospital setting, this means the patients, staff and the general public have the right to request information from hospitals and trusts and receive it within a reasonable timeframe unless there is a valid reason to withhold the information. The act aims to promote transparency and accountability within public institutions.</p>
        <h2>Subject Access Requests (SARs)</h2>
        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Subject access requests allow for individuals to be able to obtain a copy of their personal data by an organisation.</p>
        <h3>What this means?</h3>
        <p>Individuals can request a copy of information held by the hopsital or trust. It is the patients legal right to be able to request this information. Patients can request this information in writing or verbally. To combat fraudulent requests from other people staff of the hospital need to confirm the request is coming from the individual themselves. This could be done by providing a copy of individuals driving license, passport or birth cerificate. In addition, you can refuse a SAR on the basis that the person is not who they say they are.</p>
        <p>Once a subject access request has been made the organisation has one month to produce the information requested. If the organisation/hospital fails to act upon this the request they can be fined by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).</p>
